# COVID 19

## About

With so much media coverage of the Covid-19 outbreak, I decided that I wanted to see the data for myself. So I wrote a little script that takes the files from Johns Hopkins and allows me to develop plots and even fit the data. My intention of this collection is not to induce a panic, rather, provide information that anyone can understand. I want people to be informed rather than be influenced.

## Code

The code is organized into the following sections

1. Population Data
2. Get Latests Update from Johns Hopkins
3. Import the Data, .csv, into Matlab Data
4. Parse the Data
5. Plot the Data
